## Review Quality Standards

### Code Complexity Thresholds
- Methods > 50 lines: Suggest decomposition
- Classes > 500 lines: Suggest refactoring
- Cyclomatic complexity > 10: Flag for simplification
- Nesting depth > 4: Suggest early returns or extraction

### Performance Standards
- Render loop operations: Must be O(1) or O(n) where n is small
- Physics calculations: Document time complexity
- Memory allocations: Minimize in hot paths
- File I/O: Always async, proper error handling

### Documentation Requirements
- Public APIs: Comprehensive doc comments
- Physics formulas: Mathematical notation and references
- Complex algorithms: Step-by-step explanation
- Configuration options: Clear usage examples

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### Dart/Flutter Best Practices
- Prefer const constructors where possible
- Use named parameters for readability
- Implement proper dispose methods
- Follow effective dart style guide
- Use null safety consistently
