# Contributing to Graviton

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Graviton! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this physics simulation project.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that we expect all contributors to follow. Please be respectful and professional in all interactions.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use the GitHub issue tracker
- Provide detailed information about the bug or feature request
- Include steps to reproduce for bugs
- Check if the issue already exists before creating a new one

### Development Setup

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
   - Dart SDK (comes with Flutter)
   - Android Studio or VS Code
   - Git

2. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chipper-Technologies/graviton.git
   cd graviton
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Run in development mode
   flutter run --dart-define-from-file config/dev.json --flavor dev
   
   # Run tests
   flutter test
   
   # Code analysis
   flutter analyze
   ```

### Code Style

- Follow Dart/Flutter conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex physics calculations
- Maintain consistent formatting with `dart format`
- Run `flutter analyze` before submitting

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards
3. **Write tests** for new functionality
4. **Ensure all tests pass** (`flutter test`)
5. **Update documentation** if needed
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```

- Group related tests logically

## Physics Accuracy

When contributing physics-related code:
- Use scientifically accurate formulas
- Include references to sources
- Consider numerical precision
- Test against known solutions
- Document assumptions and limitations

## Performance Considerations

- Profile code changes for performance impact
- Optimize for mobile devices
- Consider memory usage
- Test on various device specifications
- Maintain smooth animation (60fps target)
