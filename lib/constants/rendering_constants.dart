  // Cinematic Camera - Dramatic Scoring Constants
  // These constants control how the camera scoring algorithm weighs different dramatic factors
  //
  // SCORING SCALE OVERVIEW:
  // - Baseline score: 0-10 (calm, stable orbital motion)
  // - Moderate drama: 10-50 (interesting interactions, medium speed)
  // - High drama: 50-150 (close encounters, high velocity, approaching bodies)
  // - Critical drama: 150+ (imminent collisions, extreme instability)
  //
  // The scoring algorithm combines multiple factors:
  // Score = closeEncounter + velocity + mass + approach + collision + instability
  //
  // Typical use cases:
  // - Score < 10: Ignore for camera targeting (boring)
  // - Score 10-30: Background interest, secondary targets
  // - Score 30-80: Primary camera targets for normal scenes
  // - Score 80-150: Priority targets, dramatic moments
  // - Score 150+: Emergency override, must-capture events
  //
  // When tuning these constants:
  // - Increase multipliers to make that factor more important
  // - Decrease to reduce impact on final score
  // - Consider relative importance: collision > approach > velocity > proximity > mass
