## System Architecture

The cinematic camera system is built on three core components:

1. **Prediction Engine**: Physics-based algorithms that analyze current simulation state and predict future events
2. **Camera Controller**: Intelligent positioning system that translates predicted events into optimal camera movements
3. **Transition Manager**: Smooth interpolation system that creates natural camera movements between positions

### Key Technologies
- **Runge-Kutta 4th Order Integration**: For precise orbital predictions
- **Vector Mathematics**: 3D positioning and movement calculations
- **Compositional Rules**: Rule of thirds, leading lines, and framing principles
- **Physics Analysis**: Gravitational force analysis and momentum tracking

## Available Techniques

### 1. üìç Manual Control
**Description**: Traditional user-controlled camera positioning with full manual control.

**Use Case**: When users want complete control over their viewing experience or for educational demonstrations requiring specific angles.

**Features**:
- Direct touch controls for pan, zoom, and rotation
- No AI interference or automated movements
- Immediate response to user input
- Best for: Educational presentations, detailed inspections, user-driven exploration

**AI Level**: None - Full manual control

### 2. üîÆ Predictive Orbital
**Description**: AI predicts future orbital events and positions the camera for optimal viewing of dramatic moments.

**Use Case**: Automatically captures close approaches, orbital resonances, and gravitational slingshot effects before they happen.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Orbital Prediction Engine**: Uses RK4 integration to simulate future body positions
- **Event Detection**: Identifies close approaches, periapsis/apoapsis passages, and orbital crossings
- **Camera Positioning**: Calculates optimal viewing angles using compositional rules
- **Smooth Transitions**: Interpolates camera movement to arrive at position before event occurs

**Key Algorithms**:
```dart
// Future position prediction
List<Vector3> predictFuturePositions(Body body, double timeStep, int steps)

// Event detection
List<OrbitalEvent> detectEvents(List<Body> bodies, double lookAheadTime)

// Optimal positioning
Vector3 calculateOptimalCameraPosition(OrbitalEvent event)
```

**Configuration Options**:
- **Look-ahead time**: How far into the future to predict (1-60 seconds)
- **Event sensitivity**: Threshold for detecting significant events
- **Camera lead time**: How early to move camera before event occurs
- **Transition speed**: Speed of camera movements between positions

**Best for**: Binary star systems, three-body problems, any scenario with close encounters

### 3. üñºÔ∏è Dynamic Framing
**Description**: Automatically frames multiple bodies using cinematographic composition rules.

**Use Case**: Ensures all important bodies remain visible and well-composed in the frame, adjusting zoom and position as orbits evolve.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Bounding Box Calculation**: Dynamically calculates optimal frame to include all bodies
- **Composition Rules**: Applies rule of thirds, leading lines, and symmetry principles
- **Adaptive Zoom**: Automatically adjusts zoom level to maintain good composition
- **Weighting System**: Prioritizes larger or more active bodies in composition

**Key Features**:
- Real-time bounding box adjustment
- Intelligent zoom scaling based on body distribution
- Composition score calculation for optimal positioning
- Smooth camera movements that maintain visual continuity

**Configuration Options**:
- **Framing margin**: Extra space around bodies (5-50% padding)
- **Composition strictness**: How rigidly to follow composition rules
- **Priority weighting**: Relative importance of different bodies
- **Update frequency**: How often to recalculate optimal framing

**Best for**: Solar system views, multi-body scenarios, educational overviews

### 4. ‚öñÔ∏è Physics-Aware
**Description**: Camera movements that respond to gravitational forces and momentum changes.

**Use Case**: Creates camera motion that mirrors the physics of the simulation, making gravitational effects more intuitive and visceral.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Force Visualization**: Camera movement reflects dominant gravitational forces
- **Momentum Tracking**: Camera follows momentum changes in the system

### 5. üé≠ Contextual Shots
**Description**: Context-sensitive camera angles that adapt based on current simulation state and dominant interactions.

**Use Case**: Provides the most relevant camera angle for whatever is currently happening in the simulation.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **State Analysis**: Continuously analyzes simulation for dominant patterns
- **Context Recognition**: Identifies scenarios like orbit formation, ejection events, or stable systems
- **Shot Library**: Pre-defined optimal camera positions for different contexts
- **Transition Logic**: Smart switching between different contextual modes

**Context Types**:
- **Formation Phase**: Wide shots showing initial body distribution
- **Orbit Establishment**: Medium shots focusing on emerging orbital patterns
- **Close Encounter**: Tight shots highlighting body interactions
- **Stable System**: Gentle orbital following shots
- **Chaotic Period**: Dynamic shots capturing unpredictable motion
- **Collision Event**: Impact-focused dramatic angles

**Configuration Options**:
- **Context sensitivity**: How quickly to switch between contexts
- **Shot duration**: Minimum time to hold each contextual shot
- **Transition speed**: Speed of movement between contextual positions
- **Context priority**: Which contexts take precedence

**Best for**: Educational scenarios, general viewing, automatic demonstrations

---

### 6. ‚ù§Ô∏è Emotional Pacing
**Description**: Camera timing and movement synchronized with the dramatic intensity of orbital interactions.

**Use Case**: Creates emotional engagement by matching camera behavior to the "drama" of gravitational interactions.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Drama Scoring**: Calculates "excitement level" based on relative velocities, distances, and accelerations
- **Tension Building**: Slower, closer movements during approach phases
- **Climax Moments**: Dynamic movement during closest approaches or collisions
- **Resolution Phases**: Calm, stable shots during post-interaction periods
- **Emotional Curves**: Long-form pacing that builds and releases tension

**Dramatic Elements**:
- **Tension**: Slow zoom-ins during approach phases
- **Suspense**: Camera holds position just before closest approach
- **Climax**: Fast, dynamic movement during peak interactions
- **Release**: Slow pullout shots showing aftermath
- **Reflection**: Stable shots allowing viewer to process events

**Configuration Options**:
- **Drama sensitivity**: How dramatic events must be to trigger responses
- **Pacing speed**: Overall speed of emotional progression
- **Tension duration**: How long to build tension before climax
- **Calm periods**: Duration of stable shots between dramatic moments

**Best for**: Three-body chaos, binary star dynamics, storytelling scenarios
