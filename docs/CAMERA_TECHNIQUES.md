# üé¨ Cinematic Camera Techniques

## Overview

Graviton's AI-driven cinematic camera system transforms the viewing experience by intelligently controlling camera movement to highlight the most dramatic and educational moments in gravitational simulations. The system offers three distinct approaches: manual control for traditional interaction, predictive orbital for educational tours, and dynamic framing for chaotic action tracking.

## System Architecture

The cinematic camera system is built on two core approaches:

1. **Predictive Orbital**: Tours and orbital predictions for educational scenarios
   - Predetermined cinematic tours for specific scenarios
   - Orbital mechanics predictions for event anticipation
   - Smooth, educational camera movements

2. **Dynamic Framing**: Real-time dramatic interactions for chaotic scenarios
   - Dramatic targeting system for random scenarios
   - Ultra-aggressive close-ups for chaotic interactions
   - Emergency transition interruption for dramatic moments
   - Real-time framing validation and ejection detection

### Key Technologies
- **Runge-Kutta 4th Order Integration**: For precise orbital predictions
- **Vector Mathematics**: 3D positioning and movement calculations
- **Compositional Rules**: Rule of thirds, leading lines, and framing principles
- **Physics Analysis**: Gravitational force analysis and momentum tracking

## Available Techniques

### 1. üìç Manual Control

### 2. üîÆ Predictive Orbital
**Description**: AI tours and orbital predictions for educational scenarios. Provides predetermined cinematic tours for specific scenarios and uses orbital mechanics predictions for event anticipation.

### 3. üñºÔ∏è Dynamic Framing
**Description**: Real-time dramatic targeting for chaotic scenarios. Provides ultra-aggressive close-ups and reactive camera work for unpredictable interactions.

**Use Case**: Random scenarios, chaotic three-body problems, collision detection, ejection events, and any unpredictable gravitational dynamics.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Dramatic Targeting System**: Exponential scoring for close encounters and collisions
- **Ejection Detection**: Multi-layer filtering to identify separated vs interacting bodies
- **Emergency Interruption**: Breaks transitions immediately for highly dramatic moments
- **Real-time Framing Validation**: Continuously ensures bodies stay in view
- **Ultra-aggressive Parameters**: Tight safety margins for maximum drama

**Key Features**:
- Ultra-close dramatic shots (1.5-35 unit distance range)
- 4x faster transitions for reactive tracking
- Emergency drama interruption (< 5 units or score > 80)
- Aggressive ejection detection (2.5 separation threshold)
- Real-time framing correction to prevent losing action

**Configuration Options**:
- **Drama sensitivity**: Threshold for detecting dramatic interactions
- **Safety margin**: Minimum distance multiplier (0.8-2.0)
- **Transition speed**: 4x faster for chaotic scenarios
- **Stickiness**: How long to hold on dramatic moments

**Best for**: Random scenarios, chaotic dynamics, collision courses, ejection events

---

## Technical Implementation
**Description**: Camera movements that respond to gravitational forces and momentum changes.

**Use Case**: Creates camera motion that mirrors the physics of the simulation, making gravitational effects more intuitive and visceral.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Force Visualization**: Camera movement reflects dominant gravitational forces
- **Momentum Tracking**: Camera follows momentum changes in the system
- **Energy Visualization**: Camera distance and movement speed reflect system energy
- **Gravitational Flow**: Camera path follows gravitational field lines

**Key Behaviors**:
- Camera "pulled" toward massive objects during close approaches
- Faster movement during high-energy interactions
- Gentle drifting motion during stable orbital periods
- Sudden movements during collisions or ejections

**Configuration Options**:
- **Force sensitivity**: How strongly camera responds to gravitational forces
- **Momentum damping**: Smoothing factor for camera movements
- **Energy scaling**: How energy changes affect camera motion
- **Maximum response**: Limits on camera movement speed

**Best for**: Three-body chaos, gravitational slingshots, collision scenarios

## Technical Implementation

### Core Architecture

The cinematic camera system is implemented through two main approaches:

#### CinematicCameraController
```dart
class CinematicCameraController {
  // Main camera control dispatcher
  void updateCamera(CameraTechnique technique, SimulationState state);
  
  // Predictive orbital: Tours and predictions
  void _handlePredictiveOrbital(SimulationState state);
  
  // Dynamic framing: Real-time dramatic targeting
  void _handleDynamicFraming(SimulationState state);
  
  // Smooth camera transitions with scenario-specific speeds
  void _updateCameraForBodies(List<Body> bodies, CameraState camera);
}
```

#### Key Features

**Predictive Orbital Implementation**:
- Predetermined tour phases for educational scenarios
- Orbital prediction engine for unknown scenarios
- Smooth transitions with educational pacing
- Phase-based camera positioning

**Dynamic Framing Implementation**:
- Dramatic interaction scoring with exponential distance weighting
- Emergency transition interruption for highly dramatic moments
- Real-time framing validation to keep action in view
- Ultra-aggressive camera parameters for maximum drama

### Configuration

#### Scenario-Specific Parameters
```dart
class ScenarioCameraParameters {
  final double safetyMargin;      // Distance multiplier for framing
  final double minDistance;       // Closest camera position
  final double maxDistance;       // Furthest camera position
  final int targetLockFrames;     // How long to hold dramatic shots
  final double orbitSpeed;        // Camera movement speed
}
```

**Random Scenario (Dynamic Framing)**:
- `safetyMargin: 1.3` - Dramatic but safe framing
- `minDistance: 1.5` - Ultra-close shots
- `maxDistance: 35.0` - Tight maximum framing
- `targetLockFrames: 360` - 6 seconds for intense action

**Educational Scenarios (Predictive Orbital)**:
- Higher safety margins for stable viewing
- Longer lock frames for educational pacing
- Smoother transition speeds

  final Duration transitionTime;        // How long transition should take
  final CameraMovementType type;        // smooth, quick, dramatic
}
```

### Configuration System

#### PredictiveOrbitalConfig
